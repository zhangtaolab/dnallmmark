# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-11)

**Core value:** Every number on the public leaderboard is correct and reproducible from code that external reviewers can trust. (v1.2 extension: operators drive the platform confidently from one terminal console without losing CLI parity.)
**Current focus:** Phase 7 — Pipeline-Side Enablement (FlopsCounter port + argv threading + registry overlay)

## Current Position

Phase: 7 of 12 (Pipeline-Side Enablement; 1st of 6 in v1.2)
Plan: — (not yet planned)
Status: Roadmap revised (maintainer custom-entries adjustment) — ready to discuss/plan Phase 7 (awaiting maintainer approval of the revision)
Last activity: 2026-10-11 — v1.2 roadmap revised: custom-entries category folded in (6 phases 7-12, 38/38 requirements mapped)

Progress (v1.2): [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (v0.7.1, archived):**
- Total plans completed: 24 (6 phases)
- Average duration: ~24 min/plan
- Total execution time: ~9.7 hours

**By Phase (v0.7.1):**

| Phase | Plans |
|-------|-------|
| 01 / 02 / 03 | 3 / 3 / 4 — all complete |
| 04 / 05 / 06 | 5 / 4 / 5 — all complete |

**v1.2:** no plans executed yet.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap v1.2 revision (maintainer, 2026-10-11): custom entries split along the maintainer-drawn seam — the pipeline-side registry overlay (CUST-05) joined Phase 7 (same run_sweep/run_finetune files, same byte-identical-when-absent discipline as argv parity, must precede wizard consumption); the wizard surface (CUST-01..04, CUST-06) is a dedicated Phase 9 directly after the selection foundation it marks; downstream phases renumbered 9→10, 10→11, 11→12 (free — zero plans existed)
- Custom/official registry separation is binding (maintainer refinement: 自定义不与官方放在一起，免得冲突): wizards write only user-owned `~/.config/dnallmmark/custom_{models,datasets}.json`; official `pipeline/{models,datasets}_info.json` never written by custom flows; overlay fails fast on custom-key collision with official; absent custom files = byte-identical behavior, existing tests untouched — recorded as binding constraint 11 in ROADMAP.md
- Roadmap v1.2 (pre-revision): pipeline enablement → TUI foundation → data manager → config/launch/monitor (single-GPU) → multi-GPU + extras; Phase 12 hard-gated on Phase 11 validation (maintainer sequencing 单卡→多卡); requirement count corrected 28 → 32 → 38 (CUST category added by revision)
- Roadmap v1.2: all three PIPE-* plus CUST-05 in Phase 7 — pipeline-side verification deliberately uncoupled from TUI phases; PIPE-02 folded there per coarse granularity (research sketched it as a separate "Phase 2.5")
- Roadmap v1.2: WEB-01 + TEST-01 attached to Phase 12 (canonical screens are final only after multi-GPU views exist; keeps Phase 11 focused on the bounded-smoke gate). TEST-01 follows the requirement (official snapshot goldens) over the research preference (Pilot-only assertions) — requirement wins
- Carried binding constraints (full list in ROADMAP.md): E2' maintainer dual-gate; CI GPU/dnallm-free with textual-the-library allowed in a CPU test lane (ratify in Phase 8 discuss); DNALLM repo read-only; CLI parity rule; TUI orchestrates never computes; ruff + ty gates from Phase 7 on

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- GB10 GPU work is permanently outside CI scope; ALL pipeline execution (including Phase 11's bounded smoke) requires explicit maintainer authorization — this milestone is code-first
- Zenodo record 19135551 not yet public — DATA-04's bulk entry is designed in Phase 10 but activates only when the record publishes
- ModelScope CLI flag/progress-parsing specifics are MEDIUM confidence — confirm during Phase 10 (narrow in-phase item, not a research phase)
- Custom-registry storage location (`~/.config/dnallmmark/` vs repo-local ignored dir) and the exact overlay read seam are Phase 7/9 discuss items — the user-owned-file principle itself is fixed
- v0.7.1 carryover registry questions (space/SPACE merge decision; 7 models without locatable public cards) remain maintainer-owned — outside v1.2 scope unless registries are touched

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and deferred at milestone close, most recent first:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At | Milestone |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| *(none)* | | | | |

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-10-11
Stopped at: v1.2 roadmap revised per maintainer custom-entries adjustment (overlay → Phase 7, wizards → new Phase 9, phases renumbered to 12; REQUIREMENTS.md traceability refilled 38/38)
Resume file: None

## Operator Next Steps

- Maintainer reviews/approves the revised v1.2 roadmap, then `/gsd-discuss-phase 7` (config discuss_mode: discuss)
